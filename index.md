author-about: |
    My passion is learning how to use computers to understand more about our universe. 
    With my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons with my friends and volunteering at UF's Public Nights at the Campus Teaching Observatory.
    I'm a huge fan of alternative transit, and I love finding more places to explore in Gainesville on my electric bike. 
    I also have about twenty pet plants which I care for deeply.
